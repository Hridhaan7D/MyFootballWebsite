  <h1>FOOTBALL RULES!!</h1>
 
 
  <p>
  "Football is the most played sport in the world" says Gary Jhonson 11 years old
    Well I agree, Im Hridhaan Arya 11 years old. I support Real Madrid for life(KARIM BENZEMA THE WINNER OF THE BALLAN D'OR).
    My favorite football player is Lionel Mesii and Kylian Mbappe.

  <h2>
    Some Info:
  </h2>
  
  <p>
   Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (33) than any other Spanish side.
   The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 19 times, as well as nine Spanish Super Cups and two Union of European Football Associations
   (UEFA) Cups (1985 and 1986).

  <h3>
    Why I did I start playing football:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    So football I started football because I love running and I'm really fond of kicking the ball around
    so I thought to myself why not start playing Football. At First I was a noob but after a month or so I joined Juentus(football club)
    to train there. After months and months of practicing and playing matches I became a pro and now I score goals like its nothing and 
    I even learned how to slide tackle in these months. The reason I leared how to slide tackle was because alongside playing in Juventus, I played 
    Fifa the football game on my Playstation 5.
